<h1>The Last Word</h1>
    <p>
    The Last Word is an exotic hand cannon first introduced in Destiny Year One. A Year Two version of The Last Word is available in The Taken King. The Last word excels in Crucible because of its' fast rate of fire and high impact. This hand cannon has been <em>nerfed</em> from its Year 1 iteration, with changes made to a bug that made it deal over <strong> 100 damage </strong> per headshot and would kill an enemy Guardian with only two shots. The current Year 3 version still retains the signature firing but now takes between <strong> 3 to 5 shots</strong> to kill an enemy Guardian.

    <p>
        Year One<br>
        Unlike most hand cannons, the Last Word can be fired rapidly <em> without taking your finger off the trigger </em> at the cost of <strong> significant</strong> recoil. One of its special upgrades, The Last Word, increases accuracy and damage from hip-fire shots.<br>
        
        Year Two<br>
        In Year 2, the Last Word's signature ability returns, lacking the previously given damage boost for hip fire, the rest of the weapon remains unchanged (Excluding its inclusion in Year 2's Infusion system)<br>
